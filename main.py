    [10:05 AM] Alice: Mainly social media growth, but I‚Äôm open to ads if necessary.
    [10:07 AM] Diana: I‚Äôve used XYZ Agency before. They offer different packages based on your budget.
    [10:08 AM] Ethan: I second that! XYZ Agency has some great plans.
    [10:10 AM] Frank: I can recommend ABC Marketing. They have good engagement strategies.
    [10:12 AM] George: Alice, what‚Äôs your budget like? That might help us recommend better.
    [10:14 AM] Alice: I‚Äôm willing to invest around $500 per month if it guarantees good engagement.
    [10:15 AM] Bob: Here‚Äôs what I know about XYZ Agency:
    1. Basic ($299/month) ‚Äì Social media management & content creation.
    2. Standard ($599/month) ‚Äì Includes ads management & analytics.
    3. Premium ($999/month) ‚Äì Covers full-scale marketing, SEO, and lead generation.
    [10:18 AM] Henry: I‚Äôve heard good things about their Standard plan. Seems like a good fit for you.
    [10:20 AM] Ian: The Basic plan is good for consistency, but the Standard plan helps if you want faster engagement with ads.
    [10:22 AM] Jack: I agree with Ian. If growth is your priority, the Standard plan should be your best bet.
    [10:24 AM] Alice: Got it! I‚Äôll consider the Standard plan then. Thanks, everyone!
